# Manifesto

Date: *November 10, 2024*

## People Before Profit

We're inspired by Mozilla's motto "People Before Profit." We believe profits (as long as we aren't losing millions of dollars) only entail greed and should not matter.

We will only ask for money in donations to fund our products, and will never try to maximize profits over good user experience.

## Anywhere, Everywhere

We are not one business, one industry, and not one product. We should be anywhere and everywhere, not just one thing.

From decentralized social media with Derailed to gaming with Entertainment. We're not one industry, product, nor business. We're everything, everywhere.

## Open and Free

We believe our libraries and software should be open and free to the public. This means putting much of our software into Open Source licenses and letting anyone who wishes use it.

We are believers in a push for public good, so anyone using our software should be a privilege not a chore or artifact.

## Everyone Gets A Say

We believe everyone should get a fair say in all actions. If they believe X might be better than the proposed Y and come with valid reasonings and criticisms, their word should be taken at face value and not be taken for granted.

Once any organization locks up who gets a say is when the public is no longer who they're target is, instead it becomes investors and stockholders.
